Is this thing on?

I've been meaning to start a blog for a while now, but have only just now gotten around to getting it off the ground. My hope is that this will give me a chance to write more regularly in addition to expressing my views on topics that matter to me. Exactly what that is...well, at this point I'm really not sure. If I had to guess, it would be some hodgepodge of programming/technology, the NBA, international affairs, hip hop music and culture, Arsenal, stand up comedy, traveling, tennis, the Bay Area,
coffee, learning new languages, US politics, Asian
America, jazz, China, video games, beer...

...what were we talking about again?

I'll have more interesting stuff to write about next time. I promise.
