Greetings.

I've previously been a software engineer at [Google](https://www.google.com) and [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com). Before that I studied CS as an undergrad at [UC Irvine](https://www.uci.edu).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/kelvin_tweets), [GitHub](https://www.github.com/kelvin-git), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelvin-lee-74bb7024) or reach me through [email](mailto: KelvinL.email@gmail.com).
